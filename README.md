3. Add your project files to the repository :

Run ´´´git add ´´´ [name of file] e.g. "git add index.html" or run ´´´git add --all´´´ to add all changes to all files to your commit.


Run ´´´git commit -m´´´ "Write a message about your commit here"

Run ´´´git push origin master´´´ to push your changes to the remote repository.
